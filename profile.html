		    <h2>Why Programming</h2>
		        <p>Initially I pursued Mechanical Enginerring at the university level.</p>
                <p>I found the work uninteresting and tedious and while stilll pursuing it, found myelf unenthusiastic about making this my future career</p>
                <p>However, one of the courses I was required to take was C++ programming, and I thouroughly enjoyed the course.</p>
                <p>Learning how to speak a new language and finding out how to form whatever you could imagine within that language enthralled me.</p>
                <p>Sure my skill with programming were more than limited at the time, but the potential I saw was what I wanted out of engineering.</p>    
                <p>Its been years since that coures and I'm finally able to pursue programming proper, with some new skills I've picked up over the years through work.</p>
